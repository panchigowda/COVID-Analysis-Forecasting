# COVID-19 Forecasting Project

## Project Summary

visualize the impact of COVID-19 and analyze the trend of rate of infection and recovery as well as make predictions about the number of cases expected in future based on the current trends

---

## Objective

To analyze the spread of COVID-19 and predict future case trends using historical data.

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: Dataset provided by my academic institution for learning and project purposes.
- The dataset includes confirmed, active, recovered, and death COVID-19 cases globally.

---

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, plotly.express
- Prophet (Facebook)

---

## Forecasting Highlights

- Time series forecasting performed on country-wise case data.
- Prophet models used to predict future confirmed cases.
- Visualizations illustrate trends and forecast confidence intervals.

---

## Key Insights

- The dataset spans from January 22, 2020 to July 27, 2020.
- The countries with the highest number of confirmed cases were the United States, Brazil, Russia, and India.
- Over the entire dataset period, India recorded approximately 40.8 million confirmed cases, 15.9 million active cases, and 1.1 million deaths.
- Time series decomposition shows a noticeable rise in confirmed cases starting from April 2020.
- Weekly seasonality detected by the Prophet model shows a consistent dip in cases reported on Tuesdays, with higher counts before and after.
